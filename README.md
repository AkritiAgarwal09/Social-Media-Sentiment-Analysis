# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis
To build a sentiment analysis and prediction system for social media content,  provide people with an additional function or feature to really know the sentiment behind the content and based on prediction models the unnecessary messages based on religion, igniting a group or a caste of people can be avoided by predicting the sentiment and then deciding on whether to display the content or not which can help us maintain peace and humanity.


Objective
The objectives of this project are:
To analyse the trends and the contents of a social media platform.
To conduct sentiment analysis of contents from social media datasets.
Build an interactive interface to learn about patterns in social media datasets.
Use the Datasets library to import dataset and metrics for sentiment analysis.
Train a model on the dataset using the Transformers library and use it to predict sentiment of textual data.


Libraries Used
We  are using the Python DATASET Library as it is originated from Tensorflow dataset, it thrives on large datasets, frees the user from RAM memory limitation, all datasets are memory-mapped using an efficient zero-serialization cost backend.

It also has Smart caching, is Lightweight and fast with a transparent and pythonic API and  Built-in interoperability with NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, Tensorflow 2 and JAX.

We import Transformers, it provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on different modalities such as text, vision, and audio. These models can be applied on Text, for tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, text generation, in over 100 languages.
